const shoti = new Shoti("YOUR-APIKEY"); //$shoti-xxxx
```

You can get your apikey [here](https://shoti.fbbot.org/myapikey).

## Getting Shoti

```js
const data = await shoti.getShoti({ type: "video" });
        
/* or dont specify config, by default shoti api returns videos */
const data = await shoti.getShoti();

/* Print the result */
console.log("Shoti Result:", data);
```

For getting Shoti API images:

```

## Adding Shoti

> [!NOTE]  
> Adding data to Shoti API database isn't available to everyone, you should request to the API administrators to promote your apikey into admin type.

```js
const sumakses = await shoti.newShoti({ 
  url: "https://vt.tiktok.com/XxXxxxX"
});

console.log(sumakses);
```

## Rating Shoti
This function let the user rate the quality of Shoti API output.

```js
const rate = await shoti.rateShoti({ 
  shoti_id: "xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx",
  isNotMaasim: true /* true or false */
});

console.log(rate);
```

If you rate this as 'not maasim' the score of the shoti will be increased by one, please don't abuse this feature because you can rate it multiple times.

> [!TIP]
> Honestly rating the Shoti will help our API to produce more quality Shoti videos and images.
